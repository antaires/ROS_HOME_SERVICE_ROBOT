This project utilizes numerous concepts including world construction in Gazebo, ROS concepts (packages, communication, launch files and shell commands), visualization with RViz and more broadly map generation and localization with SLAM and path planning. Taken together, these concepts allowed for the creation of an autonomous home service robot that localizes itself in a self-generated map in a simulated 3D environment. It then proceeds to a pickup location, where it picks up a simulated marker, then delivers the marker to the dropoff location (where the marker appears again). 

Accomplishing this project relied on an understanding of how ROS works, as the most challenging aspect was getting the different pieces to work together. When writing the C++ program for the markers during pickup and delivery, the most challenging aspect was getting the callback to correctly occur by adding ros::spinOnce(), and then to make sure to subscribe correctly to odom. Once everything was wired up correctly, it is exciting to see different pieces of the project communicate effortlessly. The project definitely inspired me to continue to advance in my understanding of ROS, robotics and path planning to create even more complex projects. It also encouraged me to use the available tools for a project rather than attempting to create everything from scratch, as the final results can end up a lot more polished and advanced than otherwise. Overall, the project was challenging but left a sense of accomplishment on completion.
